"""CommCare HQ MCP Server.

Provides CommCare application structure context for Claude Code sessions.
Tools let you explore app modules, form questions, and JSON field paths
for building workflow pipeline schemas.

Auth is automatic:
- CommCare HQ: reads COMMCARE_USERNAME + COMMCARE_API_KEY from project .env
- Connect API: reads CLI OAuth token from ~/.commcare-connect/token.json

Usage (stdio, for Claude Code):
    python tools/commcare_mcp/server.py
