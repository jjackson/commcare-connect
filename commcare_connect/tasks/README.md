# Tasks App - Documentation

## Overview

The Tasks app is a production-ready system for tracking and managing actions taken against Field-Level Workers (FLWs) based on various triggers (currently audit failures, but designed to support other sources like compliance issues, performance flags, or manual interventions).

**Status:** ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY - Complete data model implemented with 34 passing tests.

## ‚≠ê Streamlined View (Default)

**URL:** `/tasks/<id>/` (default "View" button)

The **Streamlined View** is an action-focused inbox designed for quick decisions. No complex workflows‚Äîjust **assign or contact** in 2 clicks.

### Key Features:

- **3 big action buttons**: Assign to NM, Assign to PM, Contact Worker (SMS/Call/Email)
- **One-click actions**: Modals open for quick assignment or contact
- **"What Happened" summary**: Understand the issue in plain language instantly
- **FLW header card**: Worker name, issue type, and opportunity in colored banner
- **Collapsible history**: Past issues available when needed (amber warning if present)
- **Simple conversation**: Just notes and comments, no system noise
- **Mark as Resolved**: Green button when issue is complete
- **Mobile-friendly**: Large touch targets, minimal navigation

üìñ **See `STREAMLINED_SUMMARY.md` for detailed rationale and user flows.**

## Enhanced View (Alternative)

**URL:** `/tasks/<id>/enhanced/`

The **Enhanced Modern UI** incorporates best practices from leading ticketing systems (Linear, Jira, Zendesk). Available for power users who prefer more features.

### Key Features:

- **Clickable workflow buttons**: One-click status changes
- **Inline editing**: Hover over fields to edit
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: C, Ctrl+Enter, ?, Esc, etc.
- **Quick actions bar**: Shortcuts, Assign, Share
- **Tabbed content**: Activity, Details, Notification tabs
- **All events visible**: Full timeline without filtering
- **Compact information density**: More on screen

üìñ **See `ENHANCED_UI_PATTERNS.md` and `UI_OBSERVATIONS_AND_IDEAS.md` for detailed documentation.**

## Purpose

This app provides three different UI prototypes to explore how Program Managers and Network Managers can:

- Track actions (warnings, deactivations, etc.) triggered by audit failures
- Review FLW history and context
- Communicate and collaborate on resolutions
- Make decisions about next steps

## Workflow States

Actions flow through these states:

1. **Open** - Newly created action awaiting review
2. **NM Review** - Network Manager is reviewing and responding
3. **PM Review** - Program Manager is reviewing NM input
4. **Resolved** - Issue resolved, FLW back in good standing
5. **Closed** - Action completed (may or may not be resolved)

## Action Types

- **Warning**: System sends notification to FLW, NM is notified (can comment)
- **Deactivation**: User temporarily deactivated from opportunity, NM can request reactivation

## URL Structure

- `/tasks/` - Main list view with filtering and statistics
- `/tasks/<id>/` - **Streamlined view (default) - action-focused**
- `/tasks/<id>/v2/` - Simplified view with progress bar
- `/tasks/<id>/enhanced/` - Enhanced modern UI with advanced features
- `/tasks/<id>/timeline/` - Timeline-based prototype
- `/tasks/<id>/cards/` - Card-based workflow prototype
- `/tasks/<id>/split/` - Split-panel with history sidebar prototype

## Mock Data

The views generate comprehensive mock data including:

- Multiple FLWs across different opportunities
- Timeline events with timestamps and actors
- Sample notifications sent to FLWs
- Historical tickets for context

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django views with Python-generated mock data
- **Frontend:**
  - TailwindCSS for styling (following existing Connect patterns)
  - Alpine.js for interactive elements (filters, tabs)
  - Font Awesome icons
- **Templates:** Django templates extending `base.html`

## Styling Consistency

All templates follow existing CommCare Connect patterns:

- Brand colors: `bg-brand-indigo`, `bg-brand-deep-purple`
- Button styles: `button button-md primary-dark`
- Stats cards layout from `audit/bulk_assessment.html`
- Table patterns from `opportunity/opportunities_list.html`

## Data Model (Implemented)

### Core Models

1. **Task** - Main model for tracking FLW actions

   - Links to user, opportunity, created_by_user, assigned_to
   - Fields: task_type, status, priority, title, description, learning_assignment_text, audit_session_id
   - Permission checking via `can_user_access(user)` method

2. **TaskEvent** - Timeline/activity tracking

   - Automatic event creation on task changes
   - Fields: event_type, actor, actor_user, description, metadata (JSON)

3. **TaskComment** - User comments on tasks

   - Simple comment model with author and content
   - Separate from events for clarity

4. **TaskAISession** - AI assistant conversation tracking
   - Stores OCS session_id for reconnection
   - Fetches transcripts just-in-time from OCS API

### Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Permission-based access** via opportunity and organization relationships
‚úÖ **CRUD operations** with form validation
‚úÖ **Event tracking** for audit trail
‚úÖ **AI assistant integration** via OCS API
‚úÖ **Comment system** for collaboration
‚úÖ **Comprehensive tests** (34 tests passing)
‚úÖ **Admin interface** for management
‚úÖ **Helper API** for future automation

### Quick Start

Create a task programmatically:

```python
from commcare_connect.tasks.helpers import create_task_from_audit

task = create_task_from_audit(
    audit_session_id=2058,
    user=flw_user,
    opportunity=opportunity,
    task_type="warning",
    description="Photo quality issues detected",
    created_by_user=pm_user,
    priority="high"
)
```

Or create via the web interface at `/tasks/create/`.

## Next Steps

1. **Configure OCS**: Add OCS_BASE_URL, OCS_API_KEY, OCS_BOT_ID to settings
2. **Integrate with Audit**: Hook up `create_task_from_audit()` to audit failures
3. **Add Notifications**: Implement email/SMS notifications for task assignments
4. **Monitor Performance**: Add indexes if needed based on query patterns

## Testing and Development

### Create Sample Tasks

Use the task creation script to create realistic sample data:

```bash
# Create Task #1001 (Reading Glasses Nigeria)
python commcare_connect/tasks/run_task_creation.py readers_nigeria

# Create multiple warning tasks
python commcare_connect/tasks/run_task_creation.py multiple_warnings

# Create escalation pattern
python commcare_connect/tasks/run_task_creation.py escalation_pattern

# Create AI interaction tasks
python commcare_connect/tasks/run_task_creation.py ai_interactions
```

See [MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md](MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md) for detailed documentation.

### Clear Tasks Data

To reset the database:

```bash
python manage.py clear_tasks --yes
```

### View Tasks

1. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Navigate to `/tasks/` for the list view
3. Click on any task to see the streamlined detail view
4. Use filters to see different subsets of tasks
5. Test create/update forms at `/tasks/create/`

### Database Status Panel

The tasks list page includes a "Database Status" panel at the bottom showing:

- Number of tasks
- Number of events
- Number of comments
- Number of AI sessions

Click the "Clear Tasks Database" button to remove all tasks data (with confirmation prompt). This is useful for:

- Resetting test data
- Cleaning up after development
- Starting fresh with new sample data

The clear operation preserves users, organizations, and opportunities - only task-specific data is removed.

## Design Decisions

- **No Database:** Keeping prototypes separate from production data allows free exploration
- **Three Approaches:** Each prototype emphasizes different aspects (chronology, modularity, context)
- **Realistic Data:** Mock data includes edge cases and various scenarios
- **Consistent Styling:** Follows existing patterns for seamless integration later
- **Alpine.js:** Lightweight interactivity without separate JS files (per project standards)

## Feedback Questions

When testing these prototypes, consider:

1. Which layout makes it easiest to understand the current situation?
2. Which view best supports decision-making about next actions?
3. Is historical context prominent enough (or too prominent)?
4. Are the action buttons clear and appropriately placed?
5. What additional information would be helpful?
