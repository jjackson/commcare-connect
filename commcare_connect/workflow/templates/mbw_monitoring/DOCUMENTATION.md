## Overview

The MBW (Mother Baby Wellness) Monitoring Dashboard is a real-time performance monitoring tool for frontline health workers (FLWs) operating within the CommCare Connect ecosystem. It provides supervisors with a unified view of FLW performance across three dimensions:

- **Overview**: High-level per-FLW summary combining cases registered, follow-up rate, GS score, GPS metrics, and quality/fraud indicators
- **GPS Analysis**: Distance-based anomaly detection using Haversine calculations to flag suspicious travel patterns
- **Follow-Up Rate**: Visit completion tracking across 6 visit types (ANC, Postnatal, Week 1, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6) with per-mother drill-down, eligibility filtering, and grace period

The dashboard runs within the **Workflow module** of Connect Labs. The UI is a React component defined as a JSX string in Python (`template.py`), transpiled client-side by Babel standalone, and rendered dynamically by `DynamicWorkflow.tsx`. All data is loaded via a single Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection, enabling real-time progress feedback during data loading.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Render code pattern**: The entire dashboard UI (~1,860 lines of JSX) lives in a Python string (`RENDER_CODE`), transpiled by Babel in the browser. Only `React` is available as a global - no imports. All declarations use `var` (not `const`/`let`) for Babel compatibility.
- **Single SSE connection**: All three tabs load data from one streaming endpoint, avoiding redundant API calls
- **Client-side filtering**: Raw data is sent once; FLW and mother filtering happens entirely in the browser via React state
- **Two-layer caching**: Pipeline-level cache (Redis) for visit form data + Django cache for CCHQ form/case data
- **Tolerance-based cache validation**: Caches are accepted if they meet count, percentage, or time-based tolerance thresholds
- **No database writes**: All data is fetched from external APIs (Connect Production + CommCare HQ) and cached transiently. Workflow state is persisted via the LabsRecord API.
- **CCHQ Form API for metadata**: Registration forms and GS forms are fetched directly from CCHQ Form API v1 (not from cases), with dynamic xmlns discovery via the Application Structure API
- **Cross-app xmlns discovery**: GS forms live in a separate supervisor app; the system searches all apps in the domain to find the correct xmlns
- **Action handler abstraction**: All user actions (assessments, task creation, OCS integration) go through a centralized `ActionHandlers` interface defined in `workflow-runner.tsx`, making the render code workflow-agnostic

## Workflow Module Integration

### How MBW Fits into the Workflow Framework

The MBW Monitoring Dashboard is one of several workflow templates registered in the Workflow module. Each template provides:

| Component | MBW Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `key` | `"mbw_monitoring"` | Unique identifier in template registry |
| `name` | `"MBW Monitoring"` | Human-readable name |
| `definition` | `DEFINITION` dict | Workflow metadata, statuses, config |
| `render_code` | `RENDER_CODE` string | Full React component as JSX |
| `pipeline_schema` | `None` | No pipeline (uses SSE stream instead) |

### Template Registry

Templates are auto-discovered by `commcare_connect/workflow/templates/__init__.py`:

```python
# Auto-discovers all modules with a TEMPLATE dict
from commcare_connect.workflow.templates import (
    TEMPLATES,           # Dict of all registered templates
    get_template,        # Get template by key
    list_templates,      # List all templates
    create_workflow_from_template,  # Create workflow + render code + optional pipeline
)
```

### Render Code Pattern

The RENDER_CODE is a Python triple-quoted string containing a single JSX function:

```javascript
function WorkflowUI({ definition, instance, workers, pipelines, links, actions, onUpdateState }) {
    // All React hooks, state, effects, and JSX go here
    // Constraints:
    //   - Only `React` is available as a global (no imports)
    //   - Use `var` for all declarations (not const/let)
    //   - No ES module syntax (import/export)
    //   - Must export a function named `WorkflowUI`
    //   - Can use React.useState, React.useEffect, React.useMemo, React.useRef, etc.
}
```

### WorkflowProps Interface

Every render code component receives these standardized props:

```typescript
interface WorkflowProps {
  definition: WorkflowDefinition;  // Template metadata, statuses, config, pipeline_sources
  instance: WorkflowInstance;      // Run data: id, status, state (selected_workers, worker_results)
  workers: WorkerData[];           // FLW list from Connect API
  pipelines: Record<string, PipelineResult>;  // Pipeline data keyed by alias (not used by MBW)
  links: LinkHelpers;              // URL helpers: auditUrl(), taskUrl()
  actions: ActionHandlers;         // 16 action methods (see Action Handler System section)
  onUpdateState: (newState: Record<string, unknown>) => Promise<void>;  // Persist state changes
}
```

### DynamicWorkflow Component

`components/workflow/DynamicWorkflow.tsx` handles the transpilation pipeline:

1. **Load Babel**: Injects `@babel/standalone` script tag on first mount
2. **Transpile**: Wraps RENDER_CODE in a factory function, transpiles JSX via `Babel.transform()`
3. **Create Component**: `eval()` the transpiled code, extract `WorkflowUI` function
4. **Render**: Wraps in `DynamicErrorBoundary`, passes all `WorkflowProps`

---

## Data Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Page Load

1. **Browser requests** `GET /labs/workflow/<definition_id>/run/?run_id=<id>&opportunity_id=<id>`
2. **WorkflowRunView** (`commcare_connect/workflow/views.py`):
   - Loads workflow definition and render code from LabsRecord API
   - Loads or creates a workflow run (with initial state)
   - Fetches worker list from Connect API
   - Serializes everything into `workflow_data` JSON
3. **run.html** template renders:
   - `{{ workflow_data|json_script:"workflow-data" }}` — JSON payload in a `<script>` tag
   - `<script src="{% static 'bundles/js/workflow-runner-bundle.js' %}?v=3" defer></script>`
   - `<div id="workflow-root" data-csrf-token="{{ csrf_token }}">`
4. **workflow-runner.tsx** bootstraps:
   - Reads JSON from `#workflow-data` script tag
   - Creates action handlers via `createActionHandlers(csrfToken)`
   - Mounts `DynamicWorkflow` component with all props

### Phase 2: Dashboard Data Loading (SSE)

After the user selects FLWs and enters the dashboard step, the render code opens an SSE connection:

```javascript
var eventSource = new EventSource(
    '/custom_analysis/mbw_monitoring/stream/?' + params.toString()
);
```

The stream view executes 6 steps, yielding progress messages at each stage:

| Step | Data Source | What It Fetches | Cache |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Connect API via AnalysisPipeline | Visit form data (13 FieldComputations: GPS, case IDs, form names, dates, parity, etc.) | Pipeline cache (Redis, config-hash based) |
| 2 | Connect API | Active FLW usernames + display names | In-memory |
| 3 | In-memory | GPS metrics (Haversine distances, daily travel) | None (computed) |
| 4a | CCHQ Form API v1 | Registration forms -> mother metadata (name, age, phone, eligibility, EDD, etc.) | Django cache (1hr) |
| 4b | CCHQ Form API v1 | Gold Standard Visit Checklist forms -> GS scores per FLW | Django cache (1hr) |
| 5 | In-memory | Follow-up metrics (visit status, completion rates with eligibility + grace period) | None (computed) |
| 6 | In-memory | Overview metrics (merge follow-up rate, GS score, GPS, quality metrics) | None (computed) |

The final SSE event contains the combined payload for all three tabs, which is stored in React state via `setDashData()`.

### Dashboard Data Snapshotting

After the first successful SSE data load, the backend saves a snapshot of all computed dashboard data to the workflow run record at `run.data["snapshot"]`. On subsequent opens, the frontend checks for a snapshot first via `GET /api/snapshot/?run_id=X` and renders immediately if found, skipping SSE streaming entirely.

**Lifecycle-based size management:**
- **In-progress runs**: Full snapshot including `followup_data.flw_drilldown` (~2.2MB for 100 FLWs). Assessors need drill-down access while working.
- **Completed runs**: On completion, `flw_drilldown` is stripped from the snapshot (~200KB). Historical reference only needs summary tables.

**Refresh**: A "Refresh Data" button in the tab bar forces a new SSE connection, re-computes all metrics, and saves a new snapshot.

**Storage**: Snapshot is stored at `run.data["snapshot"]`, a sibling to `run.data["state"]`, so `update_run_state()` shallow-merge won't interfere.

### Two-Source Visit Architecture

The follow-up rate calculation relies on two fundamentally different data sources that are merged at computation time:

| Data Layer | Source | What It Provides | Granularity |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Completed visits** | Connect API via AnalysisPipeline | Form submissions forwarded from CCHQ (ANC Visit, PNC Visit, 1 Week, etc.) with GPS, timestamps, case IDs | 1 form submission = 1 VisitRow |
| **Expected visits** (scheduled, due, missed) | CCHQ Form API (registration forms) | Visit schedules extracted from `var_visit_1..6` blocks: visit type, scheduled date, expiry date, mother_case_id | 1 registration form = up to 6 expected visit records |
| **Mother metadata** | CCHQ Form API (registration forms) | Name, phone, age, household size, eligibility, EDD, preferred visit time | 1 registration form = 1 mother record |
| **GS scores** | CCHQ Form API (GS forms, separate supervisor app) | Gold Standard assessment scores per FLW | 1 GS form = 1 FLW score |

**Key insight**: The pipeline (via Connect API) contains **only completed visits** - actual form submissions. It has no knowledge of what visits *should* exist. The expected visit schedules come entirely from CCHQ registration forms (`var_visit_1..6`). These registration forms are not available through the Connect API, so they are fetched directly from the CCHQ Form API.

**Merge logic** (in `build_followup_from_pipeline()` and `followup_analysis.py`):

1. Registration forms (from CCHQ) provide the expected visits with scheduled dates and expiry dates
2. Pipeline rows (from Connect API) provide completed form submissions with timestamps
3. For each expected visit, the system checks if a matching completed visit exists (via `COMPLETION_FLAGS` + `FORM_NAME_TO_VISIT_TYPE` normalization)
4. Unmatched expected visits become "due" or "missed" depending on the current date vs expiry date

### Data Payload Structure

The final SSE payload (`data.data`) contains:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "opportunity_id": 123,
  "opportunity_name": "MBW Nigeria",
  "from_cache": true,

- **Notes button**: Opens modal with assessment + notes for the FLW
- **Filter button**: Adds FLW to the multi-select filter
- **Task creation button**: Creates a task for the FLW (greyed out if open task exists)

### GPS Analysis Tab

Identifies potential fraud or GPS anomalies by analyzing distances between consecutive visits to the same mother case.

**Summary Cards**: Total Visits, Flagged Visits, Date Range, Flag Threshold (5 km)

**FLW Table Columns**:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| FLW Name | With avatar initial |
| Total Visits | Within date range |
| With GPS | Count + percentage |
| Flagged | Visits exceeding 5km threshold (highlighted red) |
| Unique Cases | Distinct mother_case_id count |
| Avg Case Dist | Average distance between visits to same case (km) |
| Max Case Dist | Maximum distance (red if >5km) |
| Trailing 7 Days | Sparkline bar chart of daily travel distance |

**Actions per FLW**: Filter button, Details drill-down button (no assessment or task buttons)

**Drill-Down**: Clicking "Details" on a FLW row expands an inline panel showing individual visit records with date, form name, entity, GPS coordinates, distance from previous visit, and flagged status.

### Follow-Up Rate Tab

Tracks visit completion across 6 visit types with per-mother granularity, eligibility filtering, and grace period.

**Summary Cards**: Total Visit Cases, Total FLWs, Average Follow-up Rate (color-coded: green >=80%, yellow >=60%, red <60%)

**FLW Table Columns**:

| Column | Description |

| Missed | Missed visits count |
| ANC through Month 6 | Per-visit-type breakdown showing completed/due/missed counts in mini columns |

**Eligibility Filter**: "Full intervention bonus only" checkbox (default checked). When checked, follow-up rate only counts mothers with `eligible_full_intervention_bonus = "1"`.

**Drill-Down**: Clicking a FLW row expands to show per-mother visit details with metadata (name, age, phone, registration date, household size, preferred visit time, ANC/PNC dates, EDD, baby DOB, eligibility).

## Data Sources & APIs

### Connect Production API

Used for: Visit form data, FLW names, opportunity metadata

- **Visit forms**: Fetched via `AnalysisPipeline` using `MBW_GPS_PIPELINE_CONFIG` from `pipeline_config.py`. Extracts 12 fields per visit using FieldComputations (3 use `extractor`, 9 use `path`).
- **FLW names**: `fetch_flw_names()` from `labs/analysis/data_access.py`
- **Opportunity metadata**: `GET /export/opportunity/{id}/` -> extracts `cc_domain` and `cc_app_id` from `deliver_app` or `learn_app`

Authentication: Connect OAuth token from `request.session["labs_oauth"]`

### CommCare HQ Form API v1

Used for: Registration forms (expected visit schedules + mother metadata) and Gold Standard Visit Checklist forms (GS scores). These forms are not available through the Connect API and must be fetched directly from CCHQ.

- **Registration forms**: `fetch_registration_forms()` in `data_fetchers.py`
  - Dynamically discovers xmlns for "Register Mother" via Application Structure API
  - Endpoint: `GET /a/{domain}/api/form/v1/?xmlns={xmlns}`
  - Extracts expected visit schedules and mother metadata
- **Gold Standard forms**: `fetch_gs_forms()` in `data_fetchers.py`
  - GS form lives in a separate supervisor app (not the deliver app)
  - GS App ID is configurable in the FLW selection view (default: `2ca67a89dd8a2209d75ed5599b45a5d1`)
  - `gs_app_id` stored in run state and passed to `fetch_gs_forms()`
  - If the configured GS app's xmlns cannot be found, returns empty (no fallback to download all forms)

Authentication: CommCare OAuth token from `request.session["commcare_oauth"]`

### CommCare HQ Application Structure API

Used for: Dynamic xmlns discovery

- **Single app**: `GET /a/{domain}/api/application/v1/{app_id}/` -> walks `modules[].forms[]` matching by multilingual name dict
- **All apps**: `GET /a/{domain}/api/application/v1/` -> paginated listing of all apps in the domain

## Pipeline Configuration

The `MBW_GPS_PIPELINE_CONFIG` in `pipeline_config.py` defines 13 FieldComputations for visit-level data extraction:

| Name | Type | Path / Extractor | Notes |
|------|------|-----------------|-------|
| `gps_location` | extractor | `extract_gps_location(visit_data)` | Reads `form_json.form.meta.location` |
| `case_id` | path | `form.case.@case_id` | |
| `mother_case_id` | path | `form.parents.parent.case.@case_id` | |
| `form_name` | path | `form.@name` | Has trailing space variant ("ANC Visit ") |
| `visit_datetime` | extractor | `extract_visit_datetime(visit_data)` | Reads `form_json.form.meta.timeEnd` |
| `entity_id_deliver` | paths | `form.mbw_visit.deliver.entity_id` (+ alt) | |
| `entity_name` | paths | `form.mbw_visit.deliver.entity_name` (+ alt) | |
| `parity` | path | `form.confirm_visit_information.parity__of_...` | From ANC forms only |
| `anc_completion_date` | path | `form.visit_completion.anc_completion_date` | From ANC forms only |
| `pnc_completion_date` | path | `form.pnc_completion_date` | From PNC forms only |
| `baby_dob` | path | `form.capture_the_following_birth_details.baby_dob` | From PNC forms only |
| `app_build_version` | extractor | `extract_app_build_version(visit_data)` | Integer from `form_json.form.meta.app_build_version` |
| `bf_status` | paths | `form.feeding_history.{pnc,oneweek,onemonth,threemonth,sixmonth}_current_bf_status` | Multi-choice, space-separated; "ebf" = exclusive breastfeeding. From postnatal forms only (not ANC). |

**Important**: Three fields (`gps_location`, `visit_datetime`, `app_build_version`) use the `extractor` parameter instead of `path+transform`. This is required because the PythonRedis backend cannot pass the full visit dict to transform functions - it only passes the extracted path value. The `extractor` parameter receives the full `visit._data` dict directly.

---

## Follow-Up Rate Business Logic

### Business Definition

**Follow-up rate** = % of visits due 5+ days ago that have been completed, among mothers marked as eligible for full intervention bonus at registration.

### Key Constants

```python
GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS = 5       # Only count visits due 5+ days ago
THRESHOLD_GREEN = 80        # Follow-up rate >=80% = green
THRESHOLD_YELLOW = 60       # Follow-up rate >=60% = yellow
```

### Eligibility Filtering

- `eligible_full_intervention_bonus` is extracted from registration form top-level field
- Value `"1"` = eligible, `"0"` = not eligible
- Non-eligible mothers show "Not eligible" badge in drill-down and "N/A" rate

### Visit Status Calculation

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| Completed - On Time | Completed within the on-time window (varies by visit type) |
| Completed - Late | Completed after on-time window but before expiry |
| Due - On Time | Not completed, within on-time window |
| Due - Late | Not completed, past on-time window but before expiry |
| Missed | Not completed, past expiry date |

#### On-Time Windows by Visit Type (MBW Schedule Spec)

| Visit Type | Scheduled Date | On-Time Range | Late Range | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ANC Visit | 28 weeks (or today if >=28 weeks at registration) | Within 7 days of scheduled date | >7 days, before delivery | After delivery |
| PNC / Postnatal Delivery Visit | EDD (expected delivery date) | Delivery through **4 days** post delivery | 5-6 days after delivery | 7+ days after delivery |
| 1 Week Visit | 7 days after delivery | 7-13 days after delivery (within 7 days of scheduled) | 14-29 days after delivery | 30+ days after delivery |
| 1 Month Visit | 30 days after delivery | 30-36 days (within 7 days of scheduled) | 37-89 days after delivery | 90+ days after delivery |
| 3 Month Visit | 90 days after delivery | 90-96 days (within 7 days of scheduled) | 97-179 days after delivery | 180+ days after delivery |
| 6 Month Visit | 180 days after delivery | 180-186 days (within 7 days of scheduled) | — | — |

Configured via `VISIT_ON_TIME_DAYS` mapping in `followup_analysis.py`. Expiry dates come from CommCare case properties (`visit_expiry_date`). Reschedule window: PNC = 3 days later, all others = 7 days later.

### Key Mappings

```python
COMPLETION_FLAGS = {
    "ANC Visit": "antenatal_visit_completion",
    "Postnatal Visit": "postnatal_visit_completion",
    "Postnatal Delivery Visit": "postnatal_visit_completion",
    "1 Week Visit": "one_two_week_visit_completion",
    "1 Month Visit": "one_month_visit_completion",
    "3 Month Visit": "three_month_visit_completion",
    "6 Month Visit": "six_month_visit_completion",
}

FORM_NAME_TO_VISIT_TYPE = {
    "ANC Visit": "ANC Visit",
    "ANC Visit ": "ANC Visit",       # trailing space variant
    "Post delivery visit": "Postnatal Delivery Visit",
    "1 Week Visit": "1 Week Visit",
    "1 Month Visit": "1 Month Visit",
    "3 Month Visit": "3 Month Visit",
    "6 Month Visit": "6 Month Visit",
}
```

---

## Quality Metrics

Computed per FLW in `compute_overview_quality_metrics()` from `followup_analysis.py`:

| Metric | Description | Fraud Signal |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Phone Dup % | % of mothers sharing duplicate phone numbers | High % = possible fabrication |
| ANC = PNC | Count of mothers where ANC and PNC completion dates are identical | Same-day = suspicious |
| Parity Concentration | % of parity values appearing more than once + mode value | High concentration = possible data copying |
| Age Concentration | % of age values appearing more than once + mode value | High concentration = possible data copying |
| Age = Reg % | % of mothers where DOB month/day matches registration month/day | Suggests DOB was fabricated from registration date |

---

## Action Handler System

All user actions flow through the `ActionHandlers` interface, created by `createActionHandlers(csrfToken)` in `workflow-runner.tsx`. The render code calls these via the `actions` prop.

### All 16 Action Handlers

| # | Action | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `createTask` | `POST /tasks/api/single-create/` | Create a task with username, title, description |
| 2 | `checkOCSStatus` | `GET /labs/workflow/api/ocs/status/` | Check if OCS OAuth is configured |
| 3 | `listOCSBots` | `GET /labs/workflow/api/ocs/bots/` | List available OCS experiments |
| 4 | `initiateOCSSession` | `POST /tasks/{taskId}/ai/initiate/` | Start OCS conversation on a task |
| 5 | `createTaskWithOCS` | Combines #1 + #4 | Create task + start OCS session |
| 6 | `startJob` | `POST /labs/workflow/api/run/{runId}/job/start/` | Start async Celery job |
| 7 | `cancelJob` | `POST /labs/workflow/api/job/{taskId}/cancel/` | Cancel running Celery task |
| 8 | `deleteRun` | `POST /labs/workflow/api/run/{runId}/delete/` | Delete workflow run |
| 9 | `streamJobProgress` | `EventSource /labs/workflow/api/job/{taskId}/status/` | SSE stream for job progress |
| 10 | `createAudit` | `POST /audit/api/audit/create-async/` | Create async audit task |
| 11 | `getAuditStatus` | `GET /audit/api/audit/task/{taskId}/status/` | Poll audit task status |
| 12 | `streamAuditProgress` | `EventSource /audit/api/audit/task/{taskId}/stream/` | SSE stream for audit progress |
| 13 | `cancelAudit` | `POST /audit/api/audit/task/{taskId}/cancel/` | Cancel audit creation |
| 14 | **`saveWorkerResult`** | `POST /labs/workflow/api/run/{runId}/worker-result/` | Save FLW assessment (MBW-specific) |
| 15 | **`completeRun`** | `POST /labs/workflow/api/run/{runId}/complete/` | Mark run completed (MBW-specific) |
| 16 | **`openTaskCreator`** | Opens `/tasks/new/?{params}` | Open task creation in new window (replaced by in-page OCS modal in MBW template) |

### MBW-Specific Action Details

**saveWorkerResult**:
```javascript
// Request
actions.saveWorkerResult(instance.id, {
    username: "flw@domain.com",
    result: "eligible_for_renewal",  // or "probation", "suspended", null
    notes: "Good performance"
})

// Response
{
    "success": true,
    "worker_results": { "flw@domain.com": { "result": "eligible_for_renewal", "notes": "...", "assessed_at": "..." } },
    "progress": { "percentage": 50, "assessed": 5, "total": 10 }
}
```

**Assessment button behavior**:
- Buttons are **toggles**: clicking an active status clears it (sends `result: null`)
- **Optimistic UI**: button state updates instantly before the API responds; reverts on error
- Only `saveWorkerResult` is called per click — `onUpdateState` is NOT called (the backend already persists the state, so the second POST to `/state/` is unnecessary)
- Notes are preserved when toggling status

**completeRun**:
```javascript
// Request
actions.completeRun(instance.id, {
    overall_result: "completed",
    notes: "All FLWs assessed"
})

// Response
{ "success": true, "status": "completed", "overall_result": "completed" }
```

### FLW Assessment Values

| Status | Value | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| (No assessment) | `null` | - | Not yet assessed |
| Eligible for Renewal | `eligible_for_renewal` | Green | Good performance |
| Probation | `probation` | Yellow | Poor performance, not eligible for renewal |
| Suspended | `suspended` | Red | Strong evidence of fraud or severe performance deficiencies |

Note: "Suspended" is a **label only** - it does NOT trigger any action on Connect.

## Caching Strategy

### Cache Layers

| Layer | What | Key Pattern | TTL | Scope |
|-------|------|------------|-----|-------|
| Pipeline Cache | Processed visit form data | Config hash-based | Configurable | Per opportunity + config hash |
| Registration Forms | CCHQ registration forms | `mbw_registration_forms:{domain}` | 1hr | Per domain |
| GS Forms | CCHQ Gold Standard forms | `mbw_gs_forms:{domain}` | 1hr | Per domain |
| Metadata Cache | Opportunity metadata | `mbw_opp_metadata:{opp_id}` | 1hr | Per opportunity_id |
| HQ Case Cache | Visit + mother cases | `mbw_visit_cases:{domain}` | 1hr prod / 24hr dev | Per domain |
| Dashboard Snapshot | Computed dashboard metrics | `run.data["snapshot"]` | Permanent (updated on refresh) | Per run |

### Tolerance-Based Cache Validation

HQ case caches use a 3-tier validation system (implemented in `_validate_hq_cache()`):

1. **Count check**: If cached case count >= requested count -> valid
2. **Percentage tolerance**: If cached/requested ratio >= threshold -> valid
3. **Time tolerance**: If cache age <= time threshold -> valid

| Mode | % Tolerance | Time Tolerance | Redis TTL |
|------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Production | 98% | 30 minutes | 1 hour |
| Dev Fixture (`MBW_DEV_FIXTURE=1`) | 85% | 90 minutes | 24 hours |

---

## Authentication & OAuth

### Triple OAuth Requirement

The dashboard uses up to three OAuth tokens:

1. **Connect OAuth** (`labs_oauth` in session): For accessing Connect Production API (visit data, FLW names, metadata)
2. **CommCare OAuth** (`commcare_oauth` in session): For accessing CommCare HQ APIs (Form API, Application API)
3. **OCS OAuth** (`ocs_oauth` in session): For AI task creation via Open Chat Studio (optional)

### Automatic Token Refresh

The `CommCareDataAccess` client automatically refreshes expired tokens:

1. `check_token_valid()` compares `expires_at` against current time
2. If expired, calls `_refresh_token()` which POSTs to `/oauth/token/` with `grant_type=refresh_token`
3. On success, updates both instance state and session storage
4. On failure, returns `False` -> caller raises `ValueError` prompting re-authorization

---

## Frontend Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| UI Rendering | React (via Babel standalone) | Component rendering, virtual DOM |
| State Management | React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useRef) | Reactive state |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS (utility classes) + inline styles | Layout and appearance |
| Data Loading | Server-Sent Events (EventSource) | Real-time streaming from backend |
| API Calls | Fetch API | Action handler requests |
| Transpilation | @babel/standalone | JSX -> JS conversion in browser |

### Render Code Constraints

Since the render code is a string transpiled by Babel in the browser:

1. **No imports** - only `React` is available as a global
2. **Use `var`** for all declarations (not `const`/`let`) to avoid Babel scoping issues
3. **No ES modules** - no `import`/`export` syntax
4. **Must define `WorkflowUI`** - the component function name that gets returned
5. **React.useState** etc. (not destructured `useState`) since no import
6. **Inline styles for dynamic values** - Tailwind classes work but dynamic CSS needs `style={{}}`
7. **No TypeScript** - plain JavaScript only

### Client-Side Filtering

All filtering happens in the browser without additional API calls:

- **FLW filter**: Multi-select listbox. Filters all three tabs by `username` set membership
- **Mother filter**: Multi-select listbox (populated from drilldown data). Filters follow-up tab
- **Date filter**: Start/end date inputs affect GPS data only
- **Eligibility checkbox**: Toggles follow-up rate eligibility filtering
- **Column selector**: Toggle individual overview columns, "Show All" / "Minimal" presets

### Sorting

Each table has independent sort state. Clicking a column header toggles ascending/descending. Numeric columns sort numerically; string columns sort alphabetically.

### Table Horizontal Scrolling

The overview table uses a CSS pattern to enable horizontal scrolling within flex layouts:

```jsx
<div style={{ width: 0, minWidth: '100%', overflowX: 'auto', WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch' }}>
    <table style={{ width: 'max-content', minWidth: '100%' }}>
```

- `width: 0; minWidth: '100%'` prevents the table's intrinsic width from propagating up through flex item `min-width: auto` defaults
- `overflowX: 'auto'` creates a horizontal scrollbar when table exceeds container width

---

## Template Sync & Build Pipeline

### Template Sync Mechanism

When `RENDER_CODE` is updated in `template.py`, existing workflows in the DB still use the old version. Two mechanisms sync the template to the DB:

**URL Parameter**: Append `?sync=true` to the workflow run URL:
```text
/labs/workflow/<id>/run/?run_id=<id>&sync=true
```
For workflows whose name doesn't match the template name, use an explicit template key:
```text
/labs/workflow/<id>/run/?run_id=<id>&sync=true&template=mbw_monitoring
```
The view matches the definition name against registered templates and updates the render code.

**API Endpoint**: `POST /labs/workflow/api/<definition_id>/sync-template/`
```json
{"template_key": "mbw_monitoring"}  // Optional, auto-detected from name
```

Both are **manual actions only** - never automatic. User-modified render code is preserved until explicitly synced.

### Static File Build Pipeline

After modifying TypeScript/JSX files, **both steps are required**:

```bash
# Step 1: Webpack builds to commcare_connect/static/bundles/js/
npm run dev

# Step 2: Django copies to staticfiles/ and updates manifest
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Django uses `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` (whitenoise). The `{% static %}` template tag resolves filenames via `staticfiles/staticfiles.json` manifest, which maps original names to content-hashed versions. Without running `collectstatic`, the manifest points to the old bundle hash even after webpack produces a new one.

| Phone | `form.mother_details.phone_number` (fallback: `back_up_phone_number`) | |
| Age | Computed from `form.mother_details.mother_dob` (fallback: `age_in_years_rounded`, `mothers_age`) | |
| Household size | `form.number_of_other_household_members` | Top-level |
| Eligibility | `form.eligible_full_intervention_bonus` | Top-level, "1"/"0" |
| Expected delivery date | `form.mother_birth_outcome.expected_delivery_date` | |
| Preferred visit time | `form.var_visit_1.preferred_visit_time` | Per-visit block |
| Mother case ID | `form.var_visit_N.mother_case_id` | First non-empty from var_visit_1..6 |

### Gold Standard Form (CCHQ, supervisor app)

## Troubleshooting

### Action Buttons Not Working (Missing Action Handlers)

**Symptom**: Clicking assessment/task/complete buttons does nothing. Console shows fewer than 16 action keys.

**Cause**: After `npm run dev`, `collectstatic` was not run. Django's manifest still points to the old bundle.

**Fix**:
```bash
npm run dev && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Table Extends Beyond Viewport (No Horizontal Scroll)

**Symptom**: With many columns, the table pushes the entire page wider. No scrollbar appears.

**Cause**: In a flex layout, flex items have `min-width: auto` by default, which prevents them from shrinking below their content's intrinsic width. The table's `width: max-content` propagates up through every ancestor.

**Fix**: Use `width: 0; min-width: 100%` on the scroll wrapper:
```jsx
<div style={{ width: 0, minWidth: '100%', overflowX: 'auto' }}>
    <table style={{ width: 'max-content', minWidth: '100%' }}>
```

Also apply `min-w-0` on React flex items in `workflow-runner.tsx` and `overflow-x-hidden` on the `run.html` content wrapper.

### Render Code Changes Not Reflected

**Symptom**: Changes to `template.py` RENDER_CODE don't appear in the UI.

**Cause**: Render code is stored in the DB (WorkflowRenderCodeRecord) at workflow creation time. Changes to the Python template don't auto-apply to existing workflows.

**Fix**: Append `?sync=true` to the workflow run URL, or POST to `/labs/workflow/api/<id>/sync-template/`.

### Follow-Up Tab Empty

**Symptom**: Follow-Up Rate tab shows 0 results.

**Cause**: CommCare OAuth token expired. Registration forms (needed for expected visit schedules) require a valid CommCare OAuth token.

**Fix**: Re-authorize CommCare OAuth via `/labs/commcare/initiate/`.

### SSE Connection Fails

**Symptom**: Dashboard shows loading spinner indefinitely.

**Cause**: The SSE endpoint at `/custom_analysis/mbw_monitoring/stream/` requires both Connect OAuth and CommCare OAuth tokens.

**Fix**: Ensure both OAuth tokens are valid in the session. Check server logs for 401/403 errors.
