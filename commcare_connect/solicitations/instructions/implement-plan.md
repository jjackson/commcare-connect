# EOI/RFP Solicitations System - CommCare Connect

## üéâ V1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for QA

**Status**: V1 implementation complete with all core features functional, this file is out of date compared to latest code and the latest code should be viewed as the source of truth.
**Last Updated**: August 17, 2025

## System Overview

A comprehensive two-phase procurement system for CommCare Connect:

1. **Expression of Interest (EOI)** - Initial screening phase
2. **Request for Proposal (RFP)** - Detailed proposal phase for EOI winners

## ‚úÖ V1 Features Implemented

1. **Program-owned Solicitations**: Programs can create and publish EOIs/RFPs
2. **Public Viewing**: Professional public pages to showcase active solicitations
3. **Authenticated Responses**: Organizations submit responses with file attachments
4. **Admin Review System**: Complete review workflow with scoring and status management
5. **Dynamic Question Builder**: Configurable questions with 5 question types
6. **Professional UI**: Consistent styling matching existing Connect design patterns

**Note**: This is a V1 implementation. Some minor features or edge cases may need refinement during QA testing.

## Technical Implementation

**AI-Generated Codebase**: This system was implemented using AI assistance, following established patterns from the existing human-authored codebase. All code mirrors patterns found in the `opportunity`, `program`, and `users` apps.

**Architecture Principles**:

- **Pattern Consistency**: Follows existing Connect patterns (models, views, templates, URLs)
- **Professional UI**: Uses established Tailwind CSS classes and component patterns, use Alpine.js for javascript
- **Frameworks**: Uses Alpine.js for javascript and Crispy forms for data entry forms.
- **Database Integration**: Proper foreign keys, indexes, and migrations
- **Security**: Same authentication/authorization patterns as existing features

## Core Data Models

### 1. Solicitation (unified model for EOI/RFP)

- `status` - draft, active, completed, closed
- `is_publicly_listed` - Boolean to control public listing visibility
- `program` - Foreign key to Program (owner)
- `created_by` - Admin who created it
- `parent_solicitation` - Self-referencing FK (RFP references parent EOI)
- `attachments` - File field for supporting documents

### 2. SolicitationResponse

- `solicitation` - Foreign key to Solicitation

## URL Structure

### Public URLs (no authentication)

- `/solicitations/` - Public listing of all active solicitations
- `/solicitations/eoi/` - EOI-only listing
- `/solicitations/rfp/` - RFP-only listing
- `/solicitations/<id>/` - Individual solicitation detail page

### Authenticated URLs (organization users)

- `/solicitations/<id>/respond/` - Submit response to solicitation
- `/solicitations/response/<id>/success/` - Response submission confirmation

### Program Manager URLs (within program context)

- `/a/<org>/program/<id>/solicitations/` - Program solicitation dashboard
- `/a/<org>/program/<id>/solicitations/create/` - Create new solicitation
- `/a/<org>/program/<id>/solicitations/<id>/edit/` - Edit solicitation
- `/a/<org>/program/<id>/solicitations/<id>/responses/` - View responses to solicitation
- `/a/<org>/program/<id>/solicitations/response/<id>/review/` - Review individual response

### Admin URLs (superuser only)

- `/solicitations/admin-overview/` - Cross-program solicitation overview

## Workflow Examples

### EOI ‚Üí RFP ‚Üí Opportunity Workflow

```
Program Manager creates EOI ‚Üí Organizations submit responses
‚Üì
Program Manager reviews EOI responses ‚Üí Accepts subset
‚Üì
Program Manager creates RFP for accepted orgs ‚Üí RFP response process
‚Üì
Program Manager reviews RFP responses ‚Üí Creates Opportunities (out of scope)
```

## üîç QA TESTING GUIDE

### Testing Approach

**IMPORTANT**: The `solicitations` app is **AI-generated** code, while the rest of the CommCare Connect codebase is **human-authored**. For debugging and styling issues, use the existing codebase as the authoritative reference.

### Reference Apps for Pattern Comparison:

- **`opportunity/`**: Best reference for similar workflow patterns
- **`program/`**: Reference for program management UI patterns
- **`users/`**: Reference for authentication and permission patterns
- **Templates in `templates/`**: Reference for consistent UI components

## üìã Recommended Testing Order

### Phase 1: Public Components (No Authentication)

```
1. Public solicitation listing (/solicitations/)
   - Test filtering by type (EOI vs RFP)
   - Verify only active solicitations show
   - Check responsive design
   - Validate professional appearance

2. Public solicitation detail pages (/solicitations/<id>/)
   - Test all solicitation types
   - Verify questions display correctly
   - Check file attachment display
   - Test "Apply Now" button redirects
```

### Phase 2: Solicitation Authoring (Program Manager)

```
1. Solicitation creation
   - Test form validation
   - Test dynamic question builder
   - Verify all question types work
   - Test draft/publish workflow

2. Solicitation editing
   - Test loading existing questions
   - Test question reordering
   - Test question deletion
   - Verify changes save correctly
```

### Phase 3: Response Submission (Organization Users)

```
1. Response submission flow
   - Test dynamic form generation
   - Test file uploads
   - Test draft saving
   - Test final submission

2. Response management
   - Test viewing submitted responses
   - Test editing draft responses
   - Verify organization context
```

### Phase 4: Review & Management (Admin/Program Manager)

```
1. Response review interface
   - Test response listing and filtering
   - Test individual review workflow
   - Test scoring system
   - Test status updates

2. Dashboard and statistics
   - Test response statistics
   - Test table functionality
   - Test admin overview
```

### Debugging Recommendations:

#### For Styling Issues:

1. **Compare with existing templates** in `templates/opportunity/` or `templates/program/`
2. **Check Tailwind classes** against existing usage in human-authored templates
3. **Verify component patterns** match existing card/table/button implementations

#### For Functional Issues:

1. **Compare views.py patterns** with `opportunity/views.py` or `program/views.py`
2. **Check URL patterns** against existing app URL structures
3. **Verify model relationships** follow same patterns as existing models

#### For JavaScript Issues:

1. **Check existing JavaScript** in `static/js/` for reference patterns
2. **Verify AJAX patterns** match existing implementations
3. **Compare event handling** with existing dynamic features

### Known Implementation Details:

- **Django Tables2** used for all data tables (following existing patterns)
- **AJAX endpoints** for question management (following opportunity app patterns)
- **File handling** mirrors existing attachment systems
- **Permission mixins** follow existing authentication patterns

## Additional Testing Considerations

### UI/UX Consistency Testing

```
‚úÖ Compare against existing Connect pages:
- Button styles should match opportunity pages
- Table formatting should match program dashboards
- Form styling should match user management forms
- Card layouts should match existing dashboard patterns
```

### Permission & Security Testing

```
‚úÖ Verify access controls:
- Anonymous users: only public pages
- Organization users: can respond to solicitations
- Program managers: can manage their program's solicitations
- Superusers: can access admin overview
```

### Data Integrity Testing

```
‚úÖ Test database operations:
- Question ordering and relationships
- File upload and storage
- Draft saving and retrieval
- Response submission workflow
- Review scoring system
```
