# Dev Team Questions

**Question**: File Upload Implementation - Django FileField vs Direct Processing?

**Context**: Code reviewer questioned whether file uploads are properly configured and if FileField approach follows project patterns.

**Current Implementation**:

- Solicitation model uses `FileField(upload_to="solicitations/attachments/")`
- ResponseAttachment model uses `FileField(upload_to="solicitations/response_attachments/")`
- Full upload/validation/deletion system implemented
