# The marketing site is a single SPA template with a History-API router in
# app.js (clean, hash-free URLs). The client picks the right <section
# data-page="…"> for the current path, so every route renders the same
# home.html. Server-side we must still list each route, otherwise a direct
# load or refresh of e.g. /platform hits Django (not the router) and 404s.
#
# All routes go through views.home (HomeView) — not a bare TemplateView — so
# {{ app_login_url }} is supplied on every page, not just "/". Keep this list
# in sync with the data-page routes in index.html upstream
# (dimagi-internal/connect-prelogin) and with sitemap.xml.
#
# Do NOT use a blanket catch-all: this host also serves the real app
# (/accounts/…, /a/<org>/…, dashboards); a wildcard would shadow it.
