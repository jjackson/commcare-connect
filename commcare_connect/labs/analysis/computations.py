    Compute field values for each visit individually (no aggregation).

    Unlike compute_fields_batch which aggregates values across visits,

    Supports both path-based extraction and custom extractors.
    Custom extractors receive the full visit data dict, enabling complex

    aggregated into histogram bins at the FLW level.
