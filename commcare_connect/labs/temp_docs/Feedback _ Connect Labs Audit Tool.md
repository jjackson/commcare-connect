**Feedback | Connect Labs Audit Tool**

**Objective:** This document is to record feedback after analyzing data using the Labs tool. The feedback may include but not be limited to:

1. What is helpful on the tool?
2. What other parameters can be added? (potential workflows that may help in automating existing tasks that we do for monitoring)
3. Can the labs structure be any different for better decision-making on RYG/FLW performance?

**Process:**
Expt 2 data was audited using the tool and wherever necessary, form and case exports were used. The steps and corresponding feedback is listed below.

**Steps followed while performing the audit for Mapping Expt 2:**
The Expt 2 audit was aimed at sending out the weekly performance report using the new tool. Since the weekly performance report is currently sent for the data submitted in the previous week and the audit tool currently doesn’t provide date filters, we needed to go to CCHQ Form exports for the weekly numbers. However, the overall status was viewed in the tool itself, following the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Checked data quality issues through the following columns in the tool:

1. % Approved Visits 2. Days Active 3. MUAC count 4. SAM/ MAM case% 5. MUAC distribution 6. Gender split

This helped know which workers needed to be flagged for data quality in the Summary email to be sent to the LLO. The names were noted down along with the issues for referencing in the email.

**Step 2:** Conducted photo audit for some of the FLWs (those with \>1 red flags on the Summary screen).
The button on the right of the FLWs’ list takes the user to the audit config screen which takes to the list of audits’ screen followed by the audit screen with images/ photo review screen.
The names of FLWs whose image submission wasn’t up to the mark, were noted for sending as a part of the audit summary via email. Flags were noted for blurry images, etc. This was done outside the audit tool.

**Step 3:** Recorded the reasons for audit failure in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ot-tduh5bsdlatgZvv1WauU8Bv0xBRtPnFyEWqTGwWg/edit?gid=902527912#gid=902527912) format for longitudinal tracking of warnings and suspensions. (A user showing unacceptable data patterns for the 3rd consecutive week for the same indicator/s is considered for suspension.)

**Step 4:** The coverage tab was checked for a quick view of the FLW-wise maps. This was to catch any major instances of camping with the help of clustered service delivery points.

**Step 5:** The summary email was completed by adding coverage metrics of ward-wise microplan completion % . This was computed using the DU case exports from CCHQ, although for other opportunities, the [ward-level report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MWyWPN09tS99lMvvHd0F32IPTBVqCSh/edit?gid=585243807#gid=585243807) from the current audit tool is helpful.

Should have the updated record of the audits done in terms of number of images passed/ failed (with audit date). | Ability to configure filters (add/ remove filters) Option to see data for filtered dates alongside the total/ lifetime values (these would be additional columns) Option to export FLW-level analysis as excel file Highlight in red the values that seem out of range (provide the option to define the acceptable range) Highlight the names of all users that have at least one metric highlighted in red and provide the option to filter by names highlighted in red. Button on the far right (alongside the photo audit option) to ‘Send warning to FLW’ that sends a warning message to the FLW directly. Button at the bottom to ‘Send Summary to LLO’ that sends a Summary email along with the export of/ link to the table on this screen. It may also be mentioned in the email that any FLWs with one or more metrics flagged in red have been sent warning messages and repetition of this behavior might lead to suspension. Column for distribution of number of deliveries per DU to inform if many DUs have the same number of service deliveries and what’s the variance in the number of deliveries per DU across FLWs. |

**Misc issues/ Errors seen while working with the tool**
Generally, the screen loading time was long for the audits even when just 1% of submissions were to be audited for a FLW.
