class WorkAreaGrouper:
    """
    This class uses a spatial clustering algorithm to combine neighboring work areas into
    groups. The grouping process:

    1. Separates work areas by ward (wards are never mixed in groups)
    2. Identifies adjacent work areas using shared boundaries or proximity
    3. Uses breadth-first search (BFS) to form spatially contiguous clusters
    4. Respects a maximum building count per cluster
    5. Creates WorkAreaGroup objects and assigns work areas to them


    Adjacency Detection:
    - Two work areas are considered adjacent if they share a boundary
    - OR if they are within buffer_distance meters of each other
    - Adjacency is computed in EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) for accurate distance calculations

    Clustering Strategy:
    - Work areas are processed in a deterministic order (sorted by centroid coordinates)
    - Starting from each unvisited area, a BFS expands to adjacent areas
    - Areas are added to the cluster if they don't exceed max_buildings
    - Each cluster becomes a WorkAreaGroup

    Args:
        opportunity_id:  The ID of the opportunity whose work areas should be grouped
        max_buildings:   Maximum total building count allowed per work area group.
                         Default is 300.
        buffer_distance: Distance in meters to consider work areas as adjacent even if
                         they don't share a boundary. Default is 100 meters. This helps
                         connect work areas that are close but separated by small gaps.

    Note:
        - Only work areas without an existing work_area_group are processed
        - Work areas from different wards are never grouped together
