# Labs prototype-only dependencies
# These are experimental and NOT intended for production
#
# NOTE: Some of these may require different versions than base/production
# (e.g. pandas needs cffi 2.0.0 vs base.txt's 1.15.1)
#
# IMPORTANT: After running 'inv requirements', you must manually comment out
# Windows-only packages in labs.txt:
#   pywin32==X.X
#   pywin32-ctypes==X.X.X
# These packages break Linux deployment if not excluded.
